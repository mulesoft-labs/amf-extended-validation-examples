# AMF Extended Validation Examples

How to run:

```bash
npm i
node validate.js [mercury|mercury-oas|aip|lds]

The repository includes also the [tutorial](validation_tutorial/validation.md) (WIP) for the new extended validations.
Use the included stand-alone AMF jar to run the examples in the tutorial.
